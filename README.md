# ðŸ§±TextureResizer
### TextureResizer is a Simple and Efficient Tool for Compressing and Reducing the File Size of Textures, Running Entirely Through the Terminal.


## âœ¨Features:
* Resize textures up to a maximum resolution specified by the user.
* If a textureâ€™s resolution is below the specified maximum, it will be copied without any changes.
* The output is stored in a folder named output_texture, which contains two subfolders:
* A folder with the original texture formats.
* A folder for WebP format.


## ðŸª„How to Use:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the path to the folder containing your textures.
3. Enter the maximum resolution for the textures (if left empty, the default is 512px).
4. After processing, the output_texture folder will be created, containing the resized and WebP textures.
